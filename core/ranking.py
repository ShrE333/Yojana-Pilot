"""Rank the schemes a person qualifies for, best first, and say why.

A scheme is ranked on four things, all computed in code so the order can be explained and tested:

  match       how squarely it is aimed at this person. A scheme with four conditions they all
              meet (widow, SC, landless, income under Rs 1 lakh) is aimed at them; one with a
              single generic condition is not. Conditions on who they *are* (caste, disability,
              widowhood, occupation) count double, because that is what targeting looks like.
  value       rupees a year they could actually expect (core/benefit.py turns one-time grants,
              insurance covers and monthly payments into one comparable number).
  confidence  do we really understand the rules: checked by a person > every rule read >
              some conditions left for them to check.
  effort      how hard it is to claim: documents to gather, and the extractor's effort guess.

score = 3*match + value_points + confidence - effort

`start_with` is the single best one (the blueprint warns that a long list causes fewer
applications, not more). `lesser_known` is the same ranking limited to schemes people rarely
hear about, which is where the unclaimed money is.
